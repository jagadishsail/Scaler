## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:

Local Storage: Local storage is accessible via JavaScript, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks. If an attacker manages to inject malicious scripts into your application, they can easily access tokens stored in local storage.

HTTP Headers: When tokens are sent in HTTP headers (such as the Authorization header), they are less accessible to malicious scripts because they are not stored in a way that JavaScript can easily access.

## Same-Site Cookie Attribute:

Cookies: Using cookies with the HttpOnly and SameSite attributes provides additional security measures. The HttpOnly attribute prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, and the SameSite attribute helps mitigate CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.

Local Storage: These security attributes are not available for local storage, making it a less secure option for storing sensitive tokens.


## Token Exposure:

Local Storage: Any script running on your page can access tokens stored in local storage. This includes third-party scripts that might be included on the page.

HTTP Headers: When tokens are sent in headers, they are only included in HTTP requests and are not exposed to JavaScript running on the page.
