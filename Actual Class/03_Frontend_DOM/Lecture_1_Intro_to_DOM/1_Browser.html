         * Q what do you understand by browser
         * 
         *  Browser : software application that helps us to access information on the internet and
         *  present it into a human understandable  format
         * 
         * Q What are the different components/ features that makes up a browser
         * 1. cookies , local storage, session storage -> storage  
         * addressbar,button , tabs -> User Interface
         * JS engine, 
         * Rendering Engine -> convert code -> UI
         * Networking 
         * history 
         * Browser security model   
         * Dev Tools
         * 
         * 
         * Q How browser allows to access these features developer -> developing a UI app ??
         *   * WEB APIs : is the interface to access all the components or the features 
         *   *  API (Application Programming Interface) : API is an object  that represents a feature
         *      . Developer can interact with API using it's exposed props and methods
         *   * You can use JS to interact with all these API
         *   * Web APIS : console, DOM API, Web storage API (local storage, cookies, session storage).
         *   Fetch API, 
         * Note :  These all web API and JS forms your browser env
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * * First Principle is : To implement any feature -> You have to use an API given by Browser
         * and that API is always an object -> method and props and we will use JS to do it 
         * */
