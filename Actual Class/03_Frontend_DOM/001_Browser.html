         * 
         * Q: What do you understand ny browser?
         * -> Browser: software application that help us to access information on the internet and present in into human undersatnd formate.
         * 
         * Q: What are the different componenets/featutres that make up a browser?
         * ->  (storage) Cokkies, local storage, session storage, 
         *     (user interface) address bar, buttons, tabs
         *     JS engine
         *     Rendering Engine -> convert Code  into UI.
         *     Networking
         *     History.
         *     Browser securirty model.
         *     DEV Tools.
         * 
         * Q: How browser allows to access these features developer -> developing a UI app ?? 
         * ->  WEB API: Is the interface to access all the component or the features.
         *     API(Applcation Programming Interface): API is an object that represent a feature. Developer can intract with all these API's. We can use JS to interact with all these API's.
         *     
         *     WEB API's : Console, DOM API, WEB Storage API(Local storage, cokkies, session storage), Fetch API.
         * 
         *     *Note: These all web API's and JS Forms your browser env.
         * 
         *     * First Principle is : To implement any feature -> You have to use an API given by Browser
         *       and that API is always an object -> method and props and we will use JS to do it 
         *      
         *
